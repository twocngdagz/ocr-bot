# OCR Bot

> This is a messenger bot for recognizing text in an image file.

## Installation

Run `npm install` to add dependencies. The app requires a messenger API token to be present in your environment variables - you can either run with `token=*token_here* node index.js` or export a token variable in your `bashrc`. If you are using Heroku you can add the variable from the settings page.
